# Memory

Notes to update:
    - Update so it is not possible to fliip the cards before the start.
            -> set var to certain value an only on start change this value. Put if statement on the function so it only works once you started the game.
    - Create a clock that is displays the time needed to complete the game.
            - Optional: create a scoreboard where you can enter your name an the best times will be displayed on start page.
